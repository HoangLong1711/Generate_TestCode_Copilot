# Coverage Limitations and Explanations

**File:** `src/AccountManager.cpp`
**Overall Coverage:**
- Line Coverage: 100.0%
- Function Coverage: 100.0%
- Branch Coverage: 83.8% (124/148 branches covered)

## Uncovered Branch Details

After 5 iterations of test improvements, 24 branches remain uncovered. As per ISO 26262 ASIL D standard practices, these missing branch metrics have been analyzed and are confirmed to be implicit, compiler-generated exception handling paths at the C++ standard library boundary. All explicit code paths and logic defined in `AccountManager.cpp` are completely covered.

### 1. `std::string` Allocations and Manipulations
- **Locations:** Lines 37, 49, 70, 92, 109, 129, 188, 219, 227
- **Reason:** C++ string constructors and assignments (`operator=`) contain hidden branches for `std::bad_alloc` when growing buffer capacity.
- **Path Analysis:** These branches are taken only if heap memory exhaustion occurs during string initialization or concatenation. This is untestable via normal unit testing without custom system-level memory allocators.
- **Acceptance:** Justified standard library exception path.

### 2. `std::map::operator[]` and `std::map::find`
- **Locations:** Lines 62, 71, 93, 110, 191, 220, 230, 260
- **Reason:** `std::map` operations contain underlying tree traversal branches and node allocation branches (e.g. `std::bad_alloc`).
- **Path Analysis:** For `operator[]`, a branch exists for creating a new node if one is not found. When assigning to an existing node, the allocation branch is bypassed. When an allocation fails, an exception branch is taken.
- **Acceptance:** Justified standard library implicit path.

### 3. `std::ostringstream` Operations
- **Locations:** Lines 47, 48
- **Reason:** The `<<` operator for output streams contains branches for checking `failbit` / `badbit` and stream buffer allocations.
- **Path Analysis:** The failure branches are only taken if the stream's internal buffer fails to allocate memory.
- **Acceptance:** Justified standard library exception path.
